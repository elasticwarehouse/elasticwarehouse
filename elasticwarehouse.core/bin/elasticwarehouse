#   -d: daemonize, start in the background
#   -p <filename>: log the pid to a file (useful to kill it later)

# CONTROLLING STARTUP:
#
# This script relies on few environment variables to determine startup
# behavior, those variables are:
#
#   ES_CLASSPATH -- A Java classpath containing everything necessary to run.
#   JAVA_OPTS    -- Additional arguments to the JVM for heap size, etc
#   ES_JAVA_OPTS -- External Java Opts on top of the defaults set
#
#
# Optionally, exact memory values can be set using the following values, note,
# they can still be set using the `ES_JAVA_OPTS`. Sample format include "512m", and "10g".
#
#   ES_HEAP_SIZE -- Sets both the minimum and maximum memory to allocate (recommended)
#
# As a convenience, a fragment of shell is sourced in order to set one or
# more of these variables. This so-called `include' can be placed in a
# number of locations and will be searched for in order. The lowest
# priority search path is the same directory as the startup script, and
# since this is the location of the sample in the project tree, it should
# almost work Out Of The Box.
#
# Any serious use-case though will likely require customization of the
# include. For production installations, it is recommended that you copy
# the sample to one of /usr/share/elasticwarehouse/elasticwarehouse.in.sh,
# /usr/local/share/elasticwarehouse/elasticwarehouse.in.sh, or
# /opt/elasticwarehouse/elasticwarehouse.in.sh and make your modifications there.
#
# Another option is to specify the full path to the include file in the
# environment. For example:
#
#   $ ES_INCLUDE=/path/to/in.sh elasticwarehouse -p /var/run/es.pid
#
# Note: This is particularly handy for running multiple instances on a
# single installation, or for quick tests.
#
# If you would rather configure startup entirely from the environment, you
# can disable the include by exporting an empty ES_INCLUDE, or by
# ensuring that no include files exist in the aforementioned search list.
# Be aware that you will be entirely responsible for populating the needed
# environment variables.
